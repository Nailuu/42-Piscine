# 42-Piscine 🏊
This repository contains all of the Piscine's projects I did during the 1st piscine of 42 Luxembourg.
Be cautious some exercices/projects didn't pass the Moulinette, like the 1st Rush and the BSQ.

It was an amazing experience, where I met incredile persons, and I learned a lot on Bash and the C programming language.
